## Data

The data used in this tutorial originates from the article of Michlmayr et al 2018, freely available at https://doi.org/10.15252/msb.20177862.

The experiment description and FCS files are available in FlowRepository under the id FR-FCM-Z238 at https://flowrepository.org/id/FR-FCM-Z238.

The attachment files include frequencies of the cell subsets searched as well as patient information. There is a first level of cell populations called "Assignment" with 31 cell groups. There is a finer level called "Profiling" with 69 cell groups. The frequency of each cell group (or cluster) is available for each FCS file.

The information about the FCS (including count of cells per FCS) was downloaded from https://flowrepository.org/experiments/2152.
